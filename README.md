# Terrains-Unity
Seamless Terrain based on location for infinity generation in Unity using either Noise or Fractals
This project demonstrates the following:

1.	Simplex Noise method:
  a.	This has multi octave support for generation of noise.
  b.	Has capability of random generation.
  c.	Currently has only 2D input support.
  d.	Support for formation of ridges.
  
2.	Diamond Square Method:
  a.	A fractal-based method.
  b.	Performs based on the already precomputed edges heights.
  c.	Support for formation of ridges.
