# Terrains-Unity
Seamless Terrain based on location for infinity generation in Unity using either Noise or Fractals

This project demonstrates the following:

Simplex Noise method:

a.	This has multi octave support for generation of noise.
  
b.	Has capability of random generation based on seed values.
  
c.	Currently has only 2D input support.
  
d.	Support for formation of ridges.

Diamond Square Method: (Yet to be Uploaded)

a.	A fractal-based method.

b.	Has capability of random generation based on seed values.
  
c.	Performs based on the already precomputed edges heights.
  
d.	Support for formation of ridges.

Midpoint Displacement Method: (Yet to be Uploaded)

a.  A fractal-based method on both 1D case and 2D case.

b.	Has capability of random generation based on seed values.
  
c.	Performs based on the already precomputed edges heights.
  
d.	Support for formation of ridges.
